<h1>Active Directory Configurations in Azure</h1>
This lab serves as a continuation of the previous one, in which I installed Active Directory and established a domain controller. In this follow-up, I will proceed with configuring Active Directory, enabling a client to join the domain, and creating user accounts.  <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 Pro (21H2)

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

Now that Active Directory is installed on the domain controller VM, it is time to create new Organizational Units and Users. With the Active Directory Users and Computers console open, right click on the domain you created (in my case, ernestotest.com) and make a new Organizational Unit (OU). I have created two Organizational Units, _EMPLOYEES and _ADMINS. The reason behind this naming scheme is because a Powershell script will be utilized later. Within the _ADMINS OU, I created a new User called Jane Doe. Jane's account will be given administrative privileges through the use of a Security Group. To grant admin privileges to a User, right click on the user and open their Properties. Click Member Of then Add to apply the appropraite security group. In this case, I added Jane to the Domain Admins security group. From now on, I will be using Jane's account to make any further changes. I will be logging off as labuser and log in as jane_admin.

To facilitate the client's integration into the domain, it is important to configure the DNS settings initially. This involves directing the DNS server to the domain controller's private IP address. To accomplish this, access the Azure portal and navigate to the Networking tab. Subsequently, select Network Interface, and within the DNS servers section, input the domain controller's private IP address. Ensure that these changes are saved by restarting the client VM. This step is essential to establish the correct DNS configuration, which is integral to domain joining and overall network functionality.

It is now time to make the client VM join the domain. In the System menu of the client VM, click on Rename this PC (advanced) and Change. Enter the domain and necessary credentials in order to let the client join the domain. I am logging in as Jane Doe for the purposes of the lab. It is important to note that the login credentials have to be input within the context of the domain path. The client should now be part of the domain. On the domain controller, the client should now appear in Computers in the Active Directory Users and Computers panel.

Before users in the domain can use the client computer, Remote Desktop has to be enabled for non-administrative users. While logged in as the administrator (in my case, Jane), open System Properties. Click on Remote Desktop and Select users that can remotely access this PC. Allow Domain Users access to Remote Desktop. Non-administrative users can now log in to Client-1. Normally a Group Policy can do the same and allows changes to many systems at once. For the purposes of this lab, a Group Policy won't be used to make this change.

The process of creating user accounts can be accomplished manually or via the utilization of a script. In the context of this lab, a PowerShell script wil be employed for this purpose <a href="https://github.com/AsiaPonder001/BunchofUsers/blob/main/README.md?plain=1)"> here. </a> The specific script required for this task can be accessed at the provided location. To proceed, it's imperative to access the domain controller and open PowerShell ISE with administrative privileges. Ensure that you are logged in using an admin account on the domain controller. Create a new file and paste the script into the PowerShell ISE console. Finally, execute the script, and you can observe the acounts being generated as per the script's instructions. This method streamlines the user creation process, enhancing efficiency and ensuring consistency in account setup.

Following the successful creation of user accounts, the next step is to sign in to "Client-1" using one of the newly generated user profiles, which were created using the PowerShell script.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

Doing this lab has made me learn how to set up Active Directory and join clients to the domain. I also created users and assigned the necessary permissions. Active Directory is not difficult to learn despite all the menu navigation that takes place. This lab is a segway for me to learn about DNS settings in-depth and file permissions in action. I will go into detail about these topics in other labs.
